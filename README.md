# 🗳️ Democracy Personality Chatbot with GPT-3.5 Turbo

A conversational AI system that combines structured personality profiling with GPT-3.5 Turbo to encourage civic engagement and promote voter participation through personalized, emotionally resonant responses.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The **Democracy Personality Chatbot** is an AI-powered application that engages users in a short questionnaire about their views on democracy and society. It then uses their responses to identify personality traits based on the **OCEAN model** (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism).

Once the dominant personality trait is identified, the system integrates **GPT-3.5 Turbo** from OpenAI to generate a custom, persuasive message that motivates the user to participate in the democratic process—especially targeted at people who have never voted or are skeptical of voting.

This project blends **rule-based profiling** and **LLM-driven generation** to create a more personal and impactful civic tech experience.
